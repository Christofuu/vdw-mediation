  <h1>Dispute Resolution</h1>
  <ul class='home-bullets'>
    <li>
      <p>
        A mediator who understands the complexities of business, the risks of
        litigation, and what is needed to reach an agreement.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Affordable fees so that the cost of the mediation itself does not become
        an issue.

    <h2>Testimonials</h2>
    <p>
      "Mates—As you can imagine, in my business I rarely recommend former
      adversaries. This is a huge exception. I highly recommend Bill VanDeWeghe,
      who has recently opened up shop as a mediator. I’ve known Bill for about
      30 years, and he has substantial experience in both litigation and
      corporate matters. He spent 15 years at a well known firm handling
      everything from personal injury and premises liability to professional
      liability matters. That is how we first met. His recent corporate
      experience of 18 years includes public and private board memberships,
      investment banking, CEO/President, and founder of companies. Whether your
      dispute involves difficult questions of liability and damages, complex
      corporate governance issues, or just difficult people, I believe Bill
      VanDeWeghe can help resolve your cases."
